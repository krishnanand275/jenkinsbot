## Section 3: SLACK BOT Token and Install App

Once you have subscribed the bot events and interactive components, let's install the App to the Slack Workspace

On your app's settings page you'll find **OAuth & Permissions** on the left navigation bar and click on **Install App to Workspace** button.

After clicking on button, you will need to authorize the bot on next page.

Now under the **Bot User OAuth Access Token** section you'll be able to find the Bot Token.

Please copy the bot token from the page and save it you will need to use it while building the bot.
